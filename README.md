This is my first project : UnitWizard

It can convert a physical quantity like length,mass,temprature into its respective different unit.

Mapping(Key):
 
 For Physical Quantity:-
 1-->Length Conversion
 2-->Mass Conversion
 3-->Temprature Conversion

 For Units:-
 
  Length:-  1==>Kilometers , 
            2==>Meters , 
            3==>Centimeters
 
  Mass:- 1==>Kilograms , 
          2==>Grams , 
          3==>Milligrams
  
  Temprature:- 1==>Celsius , 
                2==>Fahrenheit , 
                3==>Kelvin

It is still a basic project built to learn about the concept of git , github and to further my knowledge in C++. In the future versions the following functionalities will be added:

1. Energy conversion
2. Speed conversion
3. Data conversion
4. Volume conversion
5. Area conversion
6. Power conversion
7. More units of already present quantites will also be added.
